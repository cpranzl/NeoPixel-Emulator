# NeoPixel-Emulator
NeoPixel Emulator Knowlwdgestone Edition in Python with Pyglet

This emulator was forked from https://github.com/having11 and striped down to the single purpose of being a prototype for developing animations for a Neopixel strip consisting of two NeoPixel Sticks (8 x 5050RGB LED) and two NeoPixel Rings ( 16 x 5050 RGB LED). It simulates the powerup animation of a Knowledgde Stone from the computer game No Man's Sky. A powerdown animation is also implemented.
